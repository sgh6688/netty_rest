# netty_rest
A simple clean rest service with netty.

This project is a simple one for constructing rest service with netty.

It is simple and simple!

We do not need a servlet container or java ee container, just netty. Though there are some places which need to be fixed or optimised, it is ready to be run!

At last, forgive my poor Englisg. =.=
